Initial Pango support for GD.

Still no build script (this is a sandbox playgroudn)
Modify build.sh to fit your needs.

The documentation (doxygen generated) is available here:
http://www.libgd.org/pango/

Basic rotation support has been added. See examples/rotated.c.
There is no gdPangoSetAngle as I like to fully support all 
transformations transparently, without having to call GD specific
functions.

More advanced usages or improved text position can only be added
with a special GD renderer class or using the cairo backend.

The GD Renderer will be the next big addition in gd-pango.

More to come in the next weeks.
